#!/usr/bin/env sh

# A wrapper around the Nim compiler to allow for easy scripting of Nim. Puts
# all temporary files in a temporary directory and cleans up after itself.
#
# Usage:
#  - add `#!/usr/bin/env nimrun` at the beginning of your script
#  - execute the nim file with it, for example, `nimrun file.nim args`
#
# Possible future extentions:
#  - cache compilation results for a while
#  - configurable temporary directory
#  - allow for custom `nim c` parameters
